        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe. </p>
        <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. </p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Tomatoes</li>
            <li> Cheese </li>
            <li> Meat </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. 
                (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
            <li> Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. 
                Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>   
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li> 
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>

        </ol>
